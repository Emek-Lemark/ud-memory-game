## How To Play
The game starts automatically upon page load. Click the cards to reveal them. The goal is to reveal
cards two at a time to match the pairs. The game ends when all pairs are revealed.

Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
